This app is currently under development. 


Mission Statement:
Protesting is your 1st amendment right. Here at freedomap, we’re building a platform to ensure that your constitutional right to protest is protected, publicized and collaborative. 

Goal: 
freedomap is an accessible web application that allows users to document and view protest opportunities in their area. The web app will be available on mobile and desktop, and provide a simple interface for users. The web app will enable users to join protests and “see” what’s happening from anywhere, any time.
